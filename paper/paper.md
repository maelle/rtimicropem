# Summary

This package aims at supporting the analysis of PM2.5 measures made with RTI MicroPEM. [RTI MicroPEM](https://www.rti.org/sites/default/files/brochures/rti_micropem.pdf) are personal monitoring devices (PM2.5 and PM10) developed by [RTI international](https://www.rti.org/).

The goal of the package functions is to help in two main tasks:

-   Checking individual MicroPEM output files after, say, one day of data collection.

-   Building a data base based on output files, and clean and transform the data for further analysis.

The documentation includes a transparent report of the data cleaning process used in the [CHAI project](http://www.chaiproject.org/).
